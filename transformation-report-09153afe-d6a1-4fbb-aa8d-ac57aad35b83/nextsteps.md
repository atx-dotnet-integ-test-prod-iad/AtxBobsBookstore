# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed Bookstore.Domain.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Data.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Web.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected in any of the three projects:

- `Bookstore.Domain`
- `Bookstore.Data`
- `Bookstore.Web`

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Verify that no warnings or errors appear during the restore process.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Review the output for any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns, even if they do not prevent a successful build.

### 3. Run Unit Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review the test results and investigate any failures.

### 4. Verify Runtime Behavior

Run the web application locally and manually verify core functionality:

```bash
dotnet run --project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj --configuration Release
```

Check the following areas at a minimum:

- Application startup completes without exceptions
- Database connectivity works as expected through `Bookstore.Data`
- Domain logic in `Bookstore.Domain` behaves correctly end-to-end
- All primary routes and pages in `Bookstore.Web` load and respond correctly

### 5. Review Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure all three projects are targeting the same framework version to avoid compatibility issues between them.

### 6. Check for Platform-Specific APIs

Search the codebase for any remaining usage of Windows-specific APIs or libraries that may have been carried over from the legacy project. Common areas to check include:

- Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- Windows-specific file path assumptions
- `System.Web` namespace references, which are not available in cross-platform .NET

Use the .NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer or the `dotnet-compatibility` tool to assist with this check:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-compatibility
```

### 7. Validate Data Layer

If `Bookstore.Data` uses Entity Framework, confirm that migrations are up to date and compatible with the target runtime:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations list --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

Apply any pending migrations to a local database instance and verify the schema is correct:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

### 8. Review Configuration Files

Confirm that `appsettings.json` and any environment-specific configuration files contain valid settings for the new project structure. Pay particular attention to:

- Connection strings
- Any paths that were previously Windows-specific
- Authentication or authorization configuration
