# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed Bookstore.Domain.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Data.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Web.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the three projects in the solution:

- `Bookstore.Domain`
- `Bookstore.Data`
- `Bookstore.Web`

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Review the output for any warnings that may indicate compatibility concerns, even if they do not block the build.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version (e.g., `net8.0`). Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### 4. Run Unit Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality behaves as expected:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Address any failing tests before proceeding.

### 5. Verify Database Connectivity (Bookstore.Data)

Since `Bookstore.Data` is a data access project, confirm the following:

- Connection strings in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` are correctly configured for the target environment.
- Any Entity Framework Core migrations are up to date. Run the following to apply pending migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project Bookstore.Data --startup-project Bookstore.Web
```

- If migrations do not exist yet, generate an initial migration:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration --project Bookstore.Data --startup-project Bookstore.Web
```

### 6. Run the Web Application Locally

Start the web application and verify it runs without runtime errors:

```bash
dotnet run --project Bookstore.Web --configuration Release
```

Navigate to the application URL printed in the console output and manually verify core functionality such as browsing, searching, and any data-driven pages.

### 7. Check for Windows-Specific APIs

Even without build errors, some APIs that compiled successfully may fail at runtime on non-Windows platforms. Review the code in all three projects for usage of:

- `Microsoft.Win32` namespaces
- Windows registry access
- Windows-specific file path assumptions (e.g., hardcoded backslashes)
- `System.Drawing` (GDI+), which has limited cross-platform support

Replace any such usages with cross-platform alternatives where applicable.

### 8. Review Logging and Configuration

Confirm that logging and configuration providers are set up using the standard .NET hosting model in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`:

- `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.{Environment}.json` are present and correctly structured.
- Logging is configured via `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` rather than any legacy framework.

### 9. Publish the Application

Once local validation is complete, publish the application to verify the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish Bookstore.Web --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to confirm all required files, static assets, and configuration files are present before deploying to the target environment.
