# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed Bookstore.Domain.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Data.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Web.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the three projects in the solution:

- `Bookstore.Domain`
- `Bookstore.Data`
- `Bookstore.Web`

The steps below outline how to validate, test, and deploy the migrated solution.

---

## 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

---

## 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm there are no errors or warnings that may have been missed:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that appear, particularly those related to nullable reference types, obsolete APIs, or platform compatibility.

---

## 3. Verify Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to a supported cross-platform version of .NET (e.g., `net8.0`):

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure none of the projects still reference `net48` or any other Windows-only framework moniker.

---

## 4. Check for Windows-Specific Dependencies

Review each project for any remaining Windows-specific APIs or packages, such as:

- `System.Web` references
- `Microsoft.Web.*` packages
- Windows registry access
- COM interop

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify any remaining platform-specific code.

---

## 5. Run the Application Locally

Start the `Bookstore.Web` project locally to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
dotnet run --project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

Navigate through the application and verify that core functionality such as data access, routing, and rendering behave as expected.

---

## 6. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains a test project, execute the tests to validate business logic and data access behavior:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review test results and investigate any failures that may indicate behavioral differences introduced during migration.

---

## 7. Validate Database Connectivity

If `Bookstore.Data` uses Entity Framework, confirm the following:

- The connection string in `appsettings.json` is correct for the target environment.
- Migrations are up to date by running:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations list --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

- Apply any pending migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

---

## 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application for deployment:

```bash
dotnet publish app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to confirm all required files and assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
