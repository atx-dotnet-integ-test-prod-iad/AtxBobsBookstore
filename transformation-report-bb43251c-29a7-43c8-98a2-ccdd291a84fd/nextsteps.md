# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed Bookstore.Domain.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Data.csproj to net8.0
- Transformed Bookstore.Web.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the three projects in the solution:

- `Bookstore.Domain`
- `Bookstore.Data`
- `Bookstore.Web`

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Check the output for any warnings that, while non-blocking, may indicate compatibility concerns worth addressing.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version (e.g., `net8.0`). Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### 4. Run Unit Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality behaves as expected:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review any failing tests and determine whether they are caused by behavioral differences in the new runtime.

### 5. Run the Web Application Locally

Start the `Bookstore.Web` project and manually verify core functionality:

```bash
dotnet run --project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj --configuration Release
```

Walk through the primary user flows (e.g., browsing books, data retrieval) to confirm that the application behaves correctly end-to-end.

### 6. Verify Database Connectivity

Since `Bookstore.Data` handles data access, confirm that:

- Connection strings in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json` are correct for the target environment.
- Any Entity Framework Core migrations are up to date by running:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations list --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

If migrations are missing or out of sync, generate and apply them:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj

dotnet ef database update --project app/Bookstore.Data/Bookstore.Data.csproj --startup-project app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj
```

### 7. Review Removed Windows-Specific APIs

Search the codebase for any APIs that were previously available in .NET Framework but may have changed behavior in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (should no longer be present)
- Windows Registry access
- `HttpContext` usage patterns
- Configuration system changes (`Web.config` vs `appsettings.json`)

```bash
grep -rn "System.Web" app/
```

### 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application to confirm the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish app/Bookstore.Web/Bookstore.Web.csproj --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory and confirm all expected assets, configuration files, and binaries are present before deploying to the target environment.
